Minecraft protocol written using Rust and `binread`.

WARNING: These crates may use insecure crates for encryption and decryption,
meaning that there is the potential for serious vulnerabilities!

If you don't like that, please PR replacements which are secure. The current
crates were selected because I wanted to write this as quickly as possible.
